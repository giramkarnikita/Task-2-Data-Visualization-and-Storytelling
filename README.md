# Task-2-Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling
This repository contains my work for Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling. It includes data analysis and visualizations created using Power BI/Tableau with the Superstore sales dataset. The goal was to present clear business insights through effective charts and a visual report.
